 Solar Radio burst classification using machine learning

Using the labled data from e-Callisto to create a sequential 2-stage ensemble classier to first detect the presence of solar phenomenon and then classify the type detected.

Thank you to Christian Monstein from the e-Callisto project for allowing access to the data.
